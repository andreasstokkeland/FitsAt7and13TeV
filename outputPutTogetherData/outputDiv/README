aliroot is used to compile the code:
https://alice-doc.github.io/alice-analysis-tutorial/building/

A .root file can be wieved with the command
root "file name".root

where you inside of root write
TBrowser "your name for the browser (for example: a)"







An explanation of the different files



Those starting with Div and then numbers between 11 to 19 and ending with .eps or .root are files with a multiplicity class over its min bias for pions at 7 Tev.
Searched for with:
ls 1*.eps
ls 1*.root
for multiplicity classes 1 to 9 
and the 10th at
ls 20.eps
ls 20.root


Those starting with Div and then numbers between 21 to 29 and ending with .eps or .root are files with a multiplicity class over its min bias for kaons at 7 Tev.
Searched for with:
ls 2*.eps
ls 2*.root
for multiplicity classes 1 to 9 
and the 10th at
ls 30.eps
ls 30.root


Those starting with Div and then numbers between 31 to 39 and ending with .eps or .root are files with a multiplicity class over its min bias for protons at 7 Tev.
Searched for with:
ls 3*.eps
ls 3*.root
for multiplicity classes 1 to 9 
and the 10th at
ls 40.eps
ls 40.root


Those starting with DivHEPData-ins and ending with .eps or .root are files with the put together data for 13 Tev.
Searched for with:
ls HEPData-ins*.eps
ls HEPData-ins*.root

Table_1
Table_2
are for pions, Table_2 having the lowest multiplicity

Table_3
Table_4 
are for kaons, Table_4 having the lowest multiplicity

Table_5
Table_6
are for protons, Table_6 having the lowest multiplicity









The Code


The code is originally from
https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/combinedFit_8C.html

But has been molded for our case




MultiFit2k7TeV.C and MultiFit2k13TeV.C are run in jobMultiFit2k.sh where the output can be put in jobMultiFit2k.log
./jobMultiFit2k.sh >& jobMultiFit2k.log &

This creates the combined fit for the 9 highest multiplicities.
The first void prints the histograms for the 9 highest multiplicities with their fit (.eps)
together with files with the soft and hard parameters and the constant for all multiplicities for one particle (.root).
The .root files are then read by a second void that puts them together.


The histograms with their fit
Pions
Comb2k17TeV.eps
Comb2k113TeV.eps

Kaons
Comb2k27TeV.eps
Comb2k313TeV.eps


Protons
Comb2k37TeV.eps
Comb2k513TeV.eps



CSoft  (put together)

cCS7TeV.eps
cCS13TeV.eps


CHard  (put together)

cCH7TeV.eps
cCH13TeV.eps
