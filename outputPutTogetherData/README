aliroot is used to compile the code:
https://alice-doc.github.io/alice-analysis-tutorial/building/

A .root file can be wieved with the command
root "file name".root

where you inside of root write 
TBrowser "your name for the browser (for example: a)"

The code


Sum7TeV.C and Sum13TeV.C are run in jobSum.sh where the output can be put in jobSum.log
./jobSum.sh >& jobSum.log &

This creates the min biases filed as Tot*.root
It also creates the file outputSum where the Tot*.root files are filed too but there in addition with Tot*.eps
			outputSum/Tot*.eps
			outputSum/Tot*.root




Div7TeV.C and Div13TeV.C are run in jobDiv.sh where the output can be put in jobDiv.log
./jobDiv.sh >& jobDiv.log &

This creates the ratio between the multiplicity classes and their min biases filed as Div*.root   
It also creates the file outputDiv where the ratios are filed too but there in addition with Div*.eps
			outputDiv/Div*.eps
			outputDiv/Div*.root

In the outputDiv folder the Combined fits are made.




AddingHistoTalkerWithFit7TeV.C and AddingHistoTalkerWithFit13TeV.C are run in jobAddingTalkerWithFit.sh where the output can be put in jobAddingTalkerWithFit.log
./jobAddingTalkerWithFit.sh >& jobAddingTalkerWithFit.log &

This code can add histograms together although it is rather done in HEPData.C (Run:   ./HEPData.sh >& HEPData.log & )
It primarily makes Levi fits for the 1st to 9th multiplicity class.
The fit parameters are then used in a function defined just before the first void.
			This function takes a ratio between two Levi functions.
			The upper is for different multiplicity classes 
			and the lower is for their min bias.
			These ratios are then plotted with the histograms from the Div*.root files.
			
			HEPDataKaonFitDiv7TeV.eps
			HEPDataKaonFitDiv13TeV.eps

			HEPDataPionFitDiv7TeV.eps
			HEPDataPionFitDiv13TeV.eps

			HEPDataProtonFitDiv7TeV.eps
			HEPDataProtonFitDiv13TeV.eps

The code also takes the n-values from the Levi function and prints them in .root files.
These are then read by a second void in which the n1- and (n2-n1)-values that belong to the same center of mass energy, \sqrt{s} = (7 or 13) TeV, are plotted together.

Runing the HEPData.C file creates the HEPData.eps file that has all the Div*.root files plotted together
